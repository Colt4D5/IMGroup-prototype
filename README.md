# Custom WordPress Theme for Imaginal Marketing Group
This template was built by the Imaginal Marketing Group Web Team with the intention of providing our clients with a more performant, highly customizable, and modern website with an emphasis on modular design. In addition to providing many design options with minimal effort, this design allows for further customizations and upgrades without a complete refactoring of the site.

## Features
- Modular components for highly customizable designs
- A global salon settings page in the WordPress admin panel to update site-wide information with a single click
- Homepage headers have been replaced with Swiper.js components with a configurable design for various transition effects
- Browser-Sync for a better development experience
- High focus on accessibility for easy navigation throughout the site for those who need assistance
- Modernized plugins to vanilla JavaScript so that we can remove jQuery from loading
